My name is Joi Best. I graduated from Old Dominion University in May 2019 with a B.S in Computer Science and December 2020 with a M.S in Computer Science.

I am passionate about coding and creating innovative solutions to solve problems. I enjoy watching movies and tv shows in my spare time. My goal is to combine my passions and hobbies together as I work on my personal Computer Science projects.

With this blog, I hope to share my passions as well as learn from others. I hope to also share my interests in my [youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIQR4EkqTQxSQ3sz1hPXlig).
